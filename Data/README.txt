The data come from the household survey conducted in the village of Buya I using ODK tools on e-tablets.

- Other .csv files are processed variables to facilitate the use;
- All information that could allow to identify survey participant name or location has been removed to protect the identity of the respondent;
- Analysis using the data should refer to the file ODK_DEMO_LAND_USE_SURVEY_v4.xls located in the 'Training & protocol' folder 
that contain the question and variable names.
- One row (ID = 63) should be removed prior to the analysis because the survey is incomplete.
